2. **Install the Sensors**: Attach the IR sensors to the front of the robot, facing downward.
3. **Wiring**: Connect the motors to the motor driver and the IR sensors to the Arduino.
4. **Programming**: Upload the line-following code to the Arduino.
5. **Testing**: Place the robot on a track and test its ability to follow the line.
